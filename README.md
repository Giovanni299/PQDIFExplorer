# PQDIF Explorer

PQDIF Explorer is a simple desktop application designed for low-level
visualization of data stored in the Power Quality Data Interchange Format.

The following lists some of the features of the PQDIF Explorer.

* Low-level visualization to complement other higher-level tools,
  such as [PQDiffractor](http://www.pqview.com/pqdiffractor/).
* Allows unambiguous discovery of all information in PQDIF files --
  including information hidden by higher-level tools, such as invalid tags.
* Useful for validation of the output produced by systems that need to write PQDIF files.
* Includes an XML file which describes all the tags and IDs in the PQDIF standard.
* Custom tags or IDs can be added to the XML and will be reflected in the PQDIF Explorer.
* Includes the GSF.PQDIF library which contains GPA's PQDIF parser for .NET applications.
